                    <h2>Bingus</h2>
                    <p class="text-center">I fucking hate <strong>bingus</strong>. Stupid bald idiot doesn't even have hair. I only wish suffering onto this "cat".<br>
                    Even thinking about this monstrosity causes me severe mental anguish.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Luna</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Luna the cat</strong> is likely the most intelligent and secretive cat on this list, as they often wear glasses to hide their eyes.<br>
                    I fear the day that Luna will run for president but they are pretty cute so it wouldn't be that bad tbh.</p>

                    <h2>Meevin</h2>
                     <p class="text-center"><strong>Meevin the cat</strong> is one of the most airplane cats that I've ever seen. It is impressive how similar Meevin and a Boeing 777 really are.<br>
                    Very silly, however meevin does not have much else going for him unfortunately.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Borzoi</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>This is not a cat.</strong> However, I do believe this dog breed deserves a spot on this funny cat top 10.<br>
                    They are often very polite and sociable, making them very likeable. Many people don't know but they actually make cartoon sound effects when touched.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Panko</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Panko the cat</strong> is a silly cat because there is a cat named Milly who looks like her. Panko is kinda lazy though but it is a pleasant sight on the eyes.<br>
                    She is often found sleeping and somehow being silly at the same time.</p>
                    <h6>also theres 4321523 pictures so automatic win</h6>

                <li>
                    <h2>Milly</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Milly the cat</strong> is know for being the most silly cat on the planet. However, due to the numerous war crimes and corruption caused by this individual I <em>shrimply</em> cannot put her on #1. <br>I apologize, but any further comments would cause legal trouble.</p>

                    <h2>Gosha (floppa)</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Gosha the cat</strong>, also known as <strong>Floppa</strong>, is one hell of a cat(?) with awesome and epic ears that flop all over the place.<br>
                    My favorite floppa line is the one where he said "it's floppin' time" and he started flopping all over the bodies of his victims (balloons).</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Uni</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Uni the cat</strong> goes by many names, such as "how to make a bomb". People often want you to look him up on google.<br>
                    Uni is often misidentified as "Maxwell", who is a blatant copy of our beloved balls mouth and local drug trafficker Uni.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Jinx</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Jinx the cat</strong> is a funny and silly cat because she has funny paws. We share the same hatred and fear for eggs which makes her very relatable and cool.<br>
                    She is by far the most silly looking cat in this list.</p>
                    <img src="../img/jinx1.gif" height="500" alt="Jinx stretching on a cat tower"/>

                <li>
                    <h2>Karel</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Karel, the most cat of them all,</strong> is by far the best cat of all 10 of these cats. It is honestly amazing that we can live in the same world and timelime as him.<br>
                    He is very good at eating important wires if they are in motion. My favorite thing he does is waking up at around 5am and clawing on doors to get in/out. Karel is for some reason also named Fret or Fritz.</p>
