                    <h2>10. Bingus</h2>
                    <p class="text-center">I fucking hate <strong>bingus</strong>. Stupid bald idiot dumbass doesn't even have hair, can't even call it a cat honestly.<br> 
                    I only wish suffering onto this """cat""". Just knowing that this monstrosity exists causes me severe mental anguish.</p>

                    <h2>9. Luna</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Luna the cat</strong> is a very fashionable cat I think. She is very cool very swag I like it.<br>
                    (james cage white reference!!!)</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>8. Meevin</h2>
                     <p class="text-center"><strong>Meevin the cat</strong> is one of the most airplane cats that I've ever seen. It is impressive how similar Meevin and a Boeing 777 really are.<br>
                    Very silly, but he unfortunately still has not taken flight, atleast not on camera.</p>
                    <img src="../img/meevin1.gif" height="500" alt="meevin with airplane ears"/>

                <li>
                    <h2>7. Borzoi</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>This is not a cat.</strong> However, I do believe this dog breed deserves a spot on this funny cat top 10. They are often very polite and sociable, making them very likeable.<br>
                        Most people don't know but they actually make cartoon sound effects when touched. Their favorite food is Pringles.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>6. Panko</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Panko the cat</strong> is one of the most cats. She is known for not being Milly</p>
                    <img src="../img/panko1.jpg" height="500" alt="Panko sitting on a chair looking at the camera with an awestruck expression"/>

                <li>
                    <h2>5. Milly</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Milly the cat</strong> is easily the silliest of them all. She literally invented being silly.<br>
                    She also created the silly planet, as shown below. This will be the next planet for humanity to inhabit hopefully. üôèüôèüôè</p>
                    <img src="../img/milly1.gif" height="500" alt="Milly being silly with the caption: Oh good heavens, the authorities are aproaching! Quick, everyone, contain your silliness! The unbridled whimsy within me:."/>

                    <h2>4. Gosha (floppa)</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Gosha the cat</strong>, also more commonly known as <strong>Floppa</strong>, is one hell of a cat(?) with awesome and epic ears that flop all over the place.<br>
                    My favorite floppa line is the one where he said "it's floppin' time!" and he started flopping all over his victims.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>3. Uni</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Uni the cat</strong> goes by many names, such as "how to make a bomb". People often want you to look him up on google.<br>
                    Uni is unfortunately often misidentified as "Maxwell", just because he looks completely identical to our beloved balls mouth cat and local drug trafficker. I dont really understand why.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>2. Jinx</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Jinx the cat</strong> is the cat of most internet by the far. She is a perfect for an internet funny; the paws, the eyes, the posture and the eggphobia.<br>
                    Jinx can also turn into a <i>Petaurus norfolcensis</i>, or a Squirrel Glider if you want to say it like any normal person.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>1. Karel</h2>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Karel, the most cat of them all,</strong> is basically every single cat in one. He can turn into cs:go pro and then into a breadcat in seconds.<br>
                    Karel is a big enjoyer of eating important cables, especially if they are moving. He is also sometimes referred to as Fret for some reason???</p>
